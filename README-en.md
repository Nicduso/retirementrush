# 🏥 Retirement Rush

**Retirement Rush** is a cooperative game set in a retirement home full of elderly residents with unique personalities and plenty of needs to meet.  
Players take on the role of nurses working together to maintain the well-being of the residents within a time limit — cooking meals, giving out medication, handling small emergencies, and improving the nursing home as they progress.
